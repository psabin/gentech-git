## Get started with git

- the stupid content tracker
- Distributed Version Control System
- Still being updated. [ORT merge strategy](https://github.blog/2021-08-16-highlights-from-git-2-33/)
- Has lots of options
- Considered to have bad DX because of bad defaults

## Understanding git terminologies

- Upstream
- Origin
- HEAD
- detached HEAD
- Working Tree
- Revision
- Dirty
- Staging Area
- dangling object
- fast forward
- central workflow

## Discuss problems we have faced with git

- Time to share experience

- During Git Merge, lost changes
- Have set Git rules:
  - Push everyday before you leave office
  - Two branch model, master and develop
  - Feature branch
  - Merge Branch as backup
- Force pushes (created problems)
